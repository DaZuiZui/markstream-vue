 * itself — worker assets are bundler-specific (`?worker` in Vite, etc.) and
 * would be fragile inside a multi-bundler library. Instead, the host app
 * creates the pool with its own bundler and injects it here; every enhanced
 * code block then forwards it as the `workerManager` runtime option so Shiki
 * tokenization runs off the main thread.
 *
 * When no pool is injected, highlighting stays on the main thread exactly as
 * before. A broken/terminated pool is non-fatal: `@pierre/diffs` falls back to
 * its main-thread highlighter when the pool reports itself unavailable.
